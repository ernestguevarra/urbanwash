## Resubmission - 5 January 2017
This is a resubmission. In this version, I have updated the invalid URL noted
on checks. Whilst the original URL is the recommended URL by the site, it
fails at times to re-direct to the appropriate site hence the message. I have
updated this to the actual working URL. This URL has been checked multiple
times since comments made and URL has kept on working.

## Resubmission - 4 January 2017
This is a resubmission. In this version, I have added further information
about the urban water and sanitation surveys specifically country, year and
aim of survey.
